<h4>Dead Seas</h4>

This game is develop on DeadFx framework(or SDK), I can't found any document about this SDK, but I fix several errors
1) Fix error for invalid position of bullet when my ship launch.
2) Fix error for collide between ship and land
   That is caused by drawing current ship to invalid location(shifted) as its size increases.
3) Fix error for drawing ship(its size increases, game resource was invalid, check and repack all resources)
